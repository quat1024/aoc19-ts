Advent Of Code 2019
===================

Here are my crappy Advent of Code 2019 solutions in TypeScript.

## Status

| Puzzle | Part 1 Status | Part 2 Status |
| -----: | ------------- | ------------- |
| Day 1  | complete      | complete      |
| Day 2  | complete      | complete      |
| Day 3  | incomplete    | not started   |
| Day 4  | complete      | complete      |

## Usage

I don't know how modern Javascript people set up their stuff :) so it's all set up in the Visual Studio Code launch.json script

* Transpile to Javascript with `tsc`
* Run `main.js` with `node`, passing in a command-line argument of the form `day-part`
  * i.e. `2-1` runs Day 2 Part 1
